## 🎨 Hosted Landing Page

For the most direct way to experience our design, we have prepared interactive prototypes for different platforms:

Web Version: Explore the layout, navigation, and key interface elements.

Mobile Version: Explore an elderly-friendly mobile adaptation designed for accessibility, readability, and ease of use.

We encourage you to view both prototypes to understand how the interface adapts across devices.
