## AI Interaction Overview
During the development of this project, I used **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** as my main AI assistant. The AI supported multiple stages of the workflow, including ideation, interface structure design, content drafting, and front-end code optimization. It served both as a creative collaborator and a technical consultant, helping to bridge design concepts and implementation details.

## Prompting Details
Below are selected prompts and summaries of their outcomes:

1. **Prompt:** *"I’ve designed a landing page prototype in Figma. Could you help me plan how to host it on GitHub Pages with a proper structure and responsive layout?"*  
   **AI Response:** The model explained a step-by-step process including creating a GitHub repository, setting up a responsive HTML/CSS/React layout, and deploying via GitHub Pages. This helped me organize the project architecture efficiently.

2. **Prompt:** *"Please help me rewrite the copy for my landing page to sound professional and engaging for a design competition submission."*  
   **AI Response:** It refined my original content into concise, engaging English while preserving the conceptual tone of the project. The suggestions balanced professionalism and creativity, improving the readability of the final version.

3. **Prompt:** *"Can you help me generate a minimal and elegant color scheme and typography setup that fits an academic-tech visual identity?"*  
   **AI Response:** The AI proposed a palette of neutral and accent colors along with typography recommendations using Google Fonts. These informed the visual refinement in Figma before exporting the final design.

4. **Prompt:** *"How should I document my AI interactions for submission? The competition requires a `chat.md` file."*  
   **AI Response:** It outlined the required structure and helped me compose this document to clearly explain how AI was integrated throughout my creative process.

5. **Prompt:** *"Please review my current code for responsiveness and accessibility and suggest improvements."*  
   **AI Response:** The model provided best practices for responsive design, including viewport scaling, semantic HTML usage, and ARIA attributes, improving both the usability and inclusiveness of the webpage.

## Project Evolution
Throughout development, AI guidance played an important role in shaping the project’s creative and technical outcomes. Its feedback accelerated the prototyping process, especially in refining layout consistency and content tone. By iteratively incorporating AI suggestions, the final design achieved a better balance between aesthetics and usability. The interaction also deepened my understanding of prompt engineering, allowing me to engage in more targeted and productive dialogue with the AI across different design and coding contexts.
